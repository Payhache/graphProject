# Hopitox

### HopiTox, what is it ?
HopiTox is an online dynamic nomogram based on Rumack equation in order to assess the potential risk for hepatotoxicity after acetaminophen acute overdose. Here are tools to calculate dose in mg/kg or acetaminophen half-life when two samples are withdrawn, and a dynamic nomogram in a user-friendly interface. HopiTox is a tool, not a replacement for medical or biological advice.
